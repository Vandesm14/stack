# Introduction

*Stack is a dynamic, stack-based, [concatenative] programming language.*

The goal of Stack is to be an **embeddable language** similar to that of Lua. Stack inherits many **metaprogramming** aspects from popular lisps such as Clojure, **out-of-the-box**. Stack allows the developer to manipulate the **code as data** at runtime without the need to learn separate syntax for macros. **What you see is what you get**.

With a native module system, it is possible to **extend the runtime** with native Rust code, providing higher flexibility for **low-level actions**.

## Getting Started

Head over to the first introductory section on [the syntax](introduction/syntax.md) to get started with Stack.

# Introduction

Welcome to Stack!

## What is Stack?

Stack is a highly dynamic stack-based language built with Rust. The goal of Stack is to build a language that is highly configurable inside and out. Similar to the metaprogramming aspects of popular lisps such as Clojure, Stack allows the developer to manipulate the code as data at runtime. With a native module system, it is possible to extend the language with native Rust code, providing higher flexibility for low-level actions.
